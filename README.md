## Project outline

London is considering an extension to its Congestion Charge programme, a daily charge for driving a vehicle within the charging zone between the hours of 07:00 and 18:00, Monday to Friday. The extension explores the revenue and environmental impact of introducing a two-tier congestion pricing policy for peak and non-peak traffic periods.
The City conducted a survey to learn more about the willingness to pay of drivers that may enter the charging zone during the peak and non-peak hours. In total, 345 such drivers have responded to the survey and their maximum willingness to pay for peak and non-peak periods is reported in the accompanying supplementary data file. Assume that the respondents represent a total of 192,000 drivers the City estimates that may potentially enter the charging zone.
Perhaps the most important motivations for implementing a Congestion Charge are to reduce emissions and to generate funds to reinvest in improving public transportation services. A main factor that determines emissions per car is the average travel speed, which in turn is influenced by the number of drivers entering the charging zone. 

The Congestion Pricing can be found [here](https://github.com/ilipan15/CongestionPricing_Revenue/blob/main/CongestionPricing.csv)

Suppose that the relationship between the number of drivers and average speed is given by the following:

- *Average Speed (in km/h) = 30 – 0.0625 * (# of cars in thousands, ‘000)*

Further, the emissions per car, which is generally measured in grams of CO2 per kilometre, can be approximated by a piecewise linear function as follows:

- *Emissions per car (g/km) = 617.5 – 16.7 * (Average Speed) if Average Speed < 25 km/h*
- *Emissions per car (g/km) = 235.0 – 1.4 * (Average Speed) if Average Speed 3 25 km/h*

1. If the programme’s objective were solely to maximise revenue and a single congestion charge were to be applied across both peak and non-peak hours, which price would maximize the total revenue? With this price in effect, what is the total level of emissions?
2. If the programme’s objective were solely to maximise revenue and a peak period pricing strategy is to be implemented, with the price for the non-peak period set at £7, what price would you recommend for the peak period? Please note the resulting revenue and emissions and compare the findings with those from part 1.
3. Suppose now that the programme’s objective is to minimize emissions rather than maximizing revenue. However, the City would like to ensure that the programme can self-sustain its operation and that a sufficient portion of the revenue is allocated to reinvest in the public transportation infrastructure. Overall, the City requires that the revenue should not fall below £1.1 million per day. Assuming a non-peak period price of £7, what price would you recommend for the peak period? Please compare the resulting revenue and emissions level with that of part 2.
